This is part(2) of the SDLC Assignment. The goal of this system is for users
to add or remove books to and from the collection as well
as listing all the books of the collection. 

To add a book to the collection, follow the prompts, and enter the (.txt) directory in this format:
 
C:\Users\YourUserName\IdeaProjects\Module 2 SDLC Assignment Part 2_T01\Books.txt

I included the Books.txt in the directory of the project, so all that should be needed to be entered is Books.txt.

In that file is 3 random books ordered in this format: Book ID#, Title of Book, Author of Book.

When entering a incorrect option, you will be met with an appropriate response. Entering a non numerical character will also 
give a the appropriate response.

This was compiled with the recommended IDE IntelliJ IDEA with Java 17
